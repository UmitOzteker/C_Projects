# C Projects 🖥️

This repository, maintained by Umit Ozteker, is a diverse collection of C programming projects. It's designed to showcase various concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of the C language. Whether you are a student learning the fundamentals or an experienced developer looking to sharpen your skills, this collection offers a wide range of hands-on examples. 🧑‍💻

## Features ✨

  * **Diverse Projects 📚**: The repository includes a variety of projects, from fundamental data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues) to complex algorithms and command-line tools.
  * **Beginner-Friendly 🌱**: Simple projects are included to help new programmers grasp core C concepts like pointers, memory management, and control structures.
  * **Data Structures & Algorithms ⚙️**: Find implementations of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, binary trees) and popular algorithms (bubble sort, quicksort, binary search).
  * **File Handling 📄**: Projects demonstrating essential file input/output operations, including reading and writing both text and binary files.
  * **Modular Code 🧩**: Projects are structured with clear, well-documented, and modular code, making them easy to understand and reuse.
  * **Educational Focus 🎓**: Each project is designed to reinforce key C programming concepts, such as loops, functions, and dynamic memory allocation.
  * **Practical Applications 🚀**: Explore real-world inspired projects, including simple games, management systems, and data processing tools.

## Installation & Usage 🚀

To get started with these projects, you'll need a C compiler like **GCC** or **Clang** installed on your system.

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmitOzteker/C_Projects.git
```

Next, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd C_Projects
```

### Compiling and Running a Project

Each project is contained in its own folder. To compile and run a specific project, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the project's folder (e.g., `cd project_folder`).
2.  Compile the source code using your C compiler.
    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o my_program
    ```
    *Note: The primary source file is typically named `main.c`.*
3.  Run the executable file.
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```

## Project Structure 📁

The repository is organized to help you easily find and explore projects:

  * `project_folder/`: Each folder represents a standalone C project with its source code and any necessary files.
  * `include/`: Contains shared header files for reusable functions or libraries.
  * `src/`: Holds source code for common utilities or modules used across projects.
  * `examples/`: Provides simple code snippets that demonstrate specific C concepts.

## Requirements 🛠️

  * A C compiler (e.g., **GCC** or **Clang**).
  * Standard C libraries (usually included with the compiler).
  * Optional: `Make` or `CMake` for building multi-file projects.
